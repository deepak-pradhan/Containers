If you intend to stop Docker entirely, including the socket, you can stop the `docker.socket` service as well:

bash

Copy code

`sudo systemctl stop docker.socket`

### To completely disable Docker (optional)

If you want to ensure that Docker does not start automatically at boot, you can disable both the `docker.service` and `docker.socket`:

bash

Copy code

`sudo systemctl disable docker.service sudo systemctl disable docker.socket`

### To re-enable Docker later

If you decide to use Docker again, you can start and enable both services:

bash

Copy code

`sudo systemctl enable docker.service sudo systemctl enable docker.socket sudo systemctl start docker`

Let me know if you need further assistance!
